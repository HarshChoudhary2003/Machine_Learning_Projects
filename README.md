# Machine Learning Projects

A collection of machine learning projects implementing various algorithms and frameworks.

## Projects

1. **Classification of Text Documents using Naive Bayes**
   - Implements document classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
   - Includes data preprocessing, feature extraction (CountVectorizer), and model evaluation.

2. **Detecting Spam Emails Using TensorFlow**
   - Uses TensorFlow/Keras to build a deep learning model for spam email detection.

3. **SMS Spam Detection using TensorFlow**
   - Another implementation of spam detection specifically for SMS messages using TensorFlow.

4. **Count number of Object using Python-OpenCV**
   - Uses OpenCV for image processing to detect and count objects (e.g., apples) in an image.
   - Includes techniques like Gaussian Blur, Canny Edge Detection, and Contours.
