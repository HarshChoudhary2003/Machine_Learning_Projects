## 🎯 Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges in the telecom and SaaS industries. This project develops an **advanced classification model** to identify customers at high risk of churning, allowing businesses to implement targeted retention strategies.

### 🌟 Key Highlights
- 🔮 **Predictive Analytics** - Identify at-risk customers before they leave
- 📊 **Feature Importance** - Understand key churn drivers
- 💹 **ROI Focused** - Quantifiable business impact
- 🛡️ **Proactive Retention** - Enable targeted interventions

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

> *How can telecom companies predict which customers are likely to churn and take preventive action?*

Losing customers is **5-25x more expensive** than retaining existing ones. This model helps:
- Reduce churn rate by identifying high-risk customers
- Optimize marketing spend on retention campaigns
- Improve customer lifetime value (CLV)
